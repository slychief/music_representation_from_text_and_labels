# Music Representation Learning from Tags and Unstructured Text



# Pre-trained models

## Music Representation Backbone Models

One Model for each experiment

## Music Simlarity Retrieval

## Music Classification




# Reproducing the Experiments

## Prerequisites

* MSD audio samples
* MSD AMG Tagsets
** Tagsets can be downloaded from https://github.com/tuwien-musicir/msd/tree/master/ground_truth_assignments/AMG_Multilabel_tagsets
** for the experiments the hdf5 archive "msd_amglabels_all.h5" is used
* MSD AMG Album Reviews

## Align your Data

* Join tag and text datasets with the MSD audio samples
* In directory ..paper.. we provide our mappings for comparison

## Extract Mel-Spectrograms

* extract Mel-Spectrograms for the audio models
